# HTML5_Brick_Breaker
A simple brick breaker game (breakout) that I used to learn HTML5 and Javascript

Just open game.html in a browser and you're good to go!

## Controls:
	move paddle: left/right arrow keys OR a/d
	Throw Ball: Space bar
	Pause game: Enter
## Other Info:
Click Restart on the Game Over screen to play again.

When bricks break a power up may spawn which will have a good or bad effect when caught with the paddle. All power ups are worth points when caught.
